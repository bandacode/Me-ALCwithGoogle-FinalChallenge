# Me-ALCwithGoogle-FinalChallenge
The final challenge of the ALCwithGoogle scholarship programme

## Getting Started
Clone the project onto your computer. Import it into your Android Studio, and build.

### Prerequisites
This application was built using Android Studio. That is the only requirement you will need, and an internet connection for dependency loading.

### Installing
Simply import the project into Android Studio, or any other preferred development environment, and run it.

## About the app
This is a journal app that records your thoughts at any given time of day. It records your thoughts to a local database (Firebase backend coming soon),
and displays them in a RecyclerView. This app was built in Kotlin with the exception of the database class, which never seems to work for me in Kotlin.

### Features
* The list of entries is displayed in a RecyclerView that groups them according to dates
* The time is displayed according to how long ago you made the journal entry
* Creating, Editing and Deleting journal entries is all handled seemlessly through a single activity, [StoryActivity](https://github.com/bandacode/Me-ALCwithGoogle-FinalChallenge/)
